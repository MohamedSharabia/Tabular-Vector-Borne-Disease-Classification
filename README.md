## Playground Series S3E13 Solution:
This repository contains a solution to the Playground Series S3E13 challenge. The challenge involves predicting the prognosis of patients based on a set of features.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this challenge is a CSV file containing 13 features and a target variable prognosis. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
## Code Organization
The code is organized into several sections:
1.	Data Loading and Preprocessing: This section loads the dataset, performs data preprocessing, and splits the data into training and testing sets.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis: This section performs exploratory data analysis on the dataset, including summary statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis.
3.	Feature Engineering: This section performs feature engineering, including encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical variables.
4.	Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning: This section selects and tunes several machine learning models, including NuSVC, ExtraTreesClassifier, BernoulliNB, SVC, NearestCentroid, RandomForestClassifier, LinearSVC, LGBMClassifier, and XGBClassifier.
5.	Model Evaluation: This section evaluates the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
6.	Submission: This section generates a submission file for the challenge.
## Models Used
The following models are used in this solution:
1.	NuSVC
2.	ExtraTreesClassifier
3.	BernoulliNB
4.	SVC
5.	NearestCentroid
